    <p>
      In the beginning of 2020, we announced our collaboration by sending around
      a postcard: Three women in stone-colored clothing sitting on the ground,
      our faces staring directly into the camera in a diagonal cascade.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/multi-favicon.png"
        alt="our favicon as three dots cascading"
      />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The postcard also contained a link to our website where we described
      ourselves and our collaboration further. As individuals, we were unique,
      and our differences allowed us to come together in a complementary way.
      Because of this, an
      <span class="phrase">alliance of islands</span> intuitively felt like our
      symbol: and it was for this reason we used three dots cascading ⋱ for our
      website’s favicon—the small icon that appears near the web browser’s
      address bar.
    </p>
    <p>Our website text ended with this:</p>
    <blockquote>“intimacy without proximity …” — Donna Haraway</blockquote>
    <p>
      It was a strange coincidence that we chose this quote in early 2020, as
      mere months later, “<span class="phrase">intimacy without proximity</span
      >” became a priority within our new world in the middle of a global
      pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around this time we also became curious about the original source of the
      quote, and, after some digging, realized it wasn’t exactly Donna Haraway.
      It was the title of an environmental ethics paper, “<a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106033315id_/http://research.pbsci.ucsc.edu:80/scienceandjustice/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Metcalf-Intimacy-without-proximity-reprint.pdf"
        >Intimacy without Proximity: Encountering Grizzlies as a Companion
        Species</a
      >,” about the relationship between grizzly bears and humans, written by
      PhD student Jacob Metcalf and published in
      <i>Environmental Philosophy</i> (2008). In the paper, Metcalf cited and
      thanked both of his teachers: Karen Barad for suggesting the title,
      “Intimacy without Proximity,” and Donna Haraway for the phrase that
      appears in the subtitle, “Companion Species.” Donna Haraway subsequently
      cited Metcalf, using the phrase “intimacy without proximity” in her essay,
      “Staying with the Trouble.”
    </p>
    <figure class="medium">
      <img src="images/multi-bears.png" alt="Three bears at a waterfall" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      At first we felt slightly embarrassed that we had mistaken the source.
      Although no one seemed to notice, it felt important to amend the citation
      to reflect the complex relationship of authors linked to the single
      phrase. Over the summer we quietly updated our CSS website with all three
      names, trailing off into the distance ...
    </p>

    <pre>
“intimacy without proximity ... ” . Donna Haraway
                                    . Jacob Metcalf
                                      . Karen Barad
</pre
    >

    which later evolved into:

    <blockquote>
      “intimacy without proximity ... ” Karen Barad ⋱ Jacob Metcalf ⋱ Donna
      Haraway
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      With this gesture, our symbol became what we’ve taken to calling a
      “multidimensional citation,” a way of tracing not only the source of a
      quote but the <span class="phrase">learning trail</span> that supports and
      surrounds it. While we realize. . . is not multidimensional, operating
      linearly on the printed page, the phrase “multidimensional” captured the
      mysterious quality we felt when imagining a more expansive citational
      practice. A citation should not be singular, but instead explicitly
      connected to the lineage of research that came before it. We hoped our
      mark would be understood as a gesture towards this truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the three names again, we asked ourselves, “Who is missing?”
      The citation could also acknowledge the people who brought this material
      to our attention, who might otherwise be left out in a traditional
      footnote. Since Mindy came across this quotation through reading another
      Haraway essay, “<a href="http://carbonfarm.us/555/haraway-art.pdf"
        >Symbiogenesis, Sympoiesis, and Art Science Activisms for Staying with
        the Trouble</a
      >” in an essay anthology edited by Anna Tsing, we tacked their names onto
      the end, too:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “intimacy without proximity ... ”<br /><br />

      Karen Barad ⋱ Jacob Metcalf ⋱ Donna Haraway ⋱ Anna Tsing ⋱ Mindy Seu
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Our mark (⋱) is similar to an ellipsis (…). When used within a quotation,
      an ellipsis depicts something omitted. Relatedly, ⋱ can be thought of as a
      prompt that asks, “Who is missing?” Through its form, ⋱ also acknowledges
      its imperfection. Listing a few names may not come close to recording the
      vastness of the network of people who helped surface an idea, but it’s a
      start. In other words, ⋱ is not necessarily a call to look up each person
      cited, but rather an acknowledgment that no one comes to an idea alone.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The biggest thing that I’ve learned from nature is the importance of
      relationships. E.g. an ecosystem isn’t just a list of living things
      (squirrel, tree, bee, flower); it’s the set of relationships between those
      living things (the squirrel lives in the tree, the bee pollinates the
      flower). In phrases of organizing, this means that a given social movement
      isn’t a list of organizations, or campaigns, or even individuals; it’s the
      set of relationships between organizations, campaigns, individuals,
      etc.<br /><br />
      — adrienne maree brown
    </blockquote>

    <p>A fuller learning trail might therefore be:</p>

    <blockquote>
      intimacy without proximity ...<br /><br />
      Karen Barad (was a teacher to ⋱ ) Jacob Metcalf (who also studied under ⋱
      ) Donna Haraway (whose essay appeared in a book by ⋱ ) Anna Tsing (that
      was read by ⋱ ) Mindy Seu
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      ⋱ is a gesture towards how culture actually happens. In the 1986 essay
      “The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,” science fiction novelist Ursula K. Le
      Guin posits that the first tool was in fact the basket rather than the
      spear, reframing our history of technology as one of gathering rather than
      domination, as outlined in this publisher’s blurb:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Hacking the linear, progressive mode of the Techno-Heroic, the Carrier Bag
      Theory of human evolution proposes: “Before the tool that forces energy
      outward, we made the tool that brings energy home.” Prior to the
      preeminence of sticks, swords, and the Hero’s killing tools, our
      ancestors’ greatest invention was the container: ... the net made of your
      own hair, the home, the shrine ... The recipient, the holder, the story.
      <br /><br />
      Ursula K. Le Guin (as summarized by ⋱ ) Ignota Books
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      ⋱ is a reminder that this learning trail is not static. It is living,
      actively being written, and capable of change: it could very well continue
      and be extended further.
    </p>
    <p>
      ⋱ is our attempt at acknowledging the multi-authored histories of ideas,
      our place within them, and our agency to extend them. Information networks
      have afforded new patterns of understanding. Anyone with an internet
      connection can access a vast amount of information and assimilate it
      themselves. How can value be created in a world of so much abundance?
      Perhaps by thoughtfully considering and relaying our learning trails.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Trails</h2>

    <p>
      In the summer of 2020, we started reading adrienne maree brown’s
      <i>Emergent Strategy</i> and then <i>Pleasure Activism</i> as a way to
      ground ourselves in new ways of thinking about organizing and working
      collectively, the uncertainty of change, and the artist’s role in social
      movements. Along the way, Laura noticed that <i>Pleasure Activism</i> was
      noted by adrienne maree brown as being “written and gathered .”
    </p>
    <p>
      brown calls herself a “gatherer,” and practices this throughout the book,
      using phrases like: “I was at this lecture ( ) when I was talking to this
      friend ( ) and meanwhile reading this book ( ) ⋱ when this idea occurred
      to me...”
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the footnotes in <i>Emergent Strategy</i> carry a set of nested
      citational links. In them, we read a phrase that resonated with the
      formation of our collaboration and the process of learning to work
      together: “move at the speed of trust.” Our interest in this phrase as a
      multidimensional citation materialized on our website on January 1, 2021:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Move at the speed of trust ...<br /><br />
      Stephen Covey ⋱ Mervyn Marcano ⋱ adrienne maree brown
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      brown’s footnote reads, “This is communications strategist Mervyn
      Marcano’s remix of Stephen Covey’s ‘speed of trust’ concept.” Our
      citational trail lists the names in chronological order: Stephen Covey’s
      conception of the “speed of trust,” followed by Mervyn Marcano’s addition,
      and finally brown’s inclusion of the quote in her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it takes more time and care to deliver — and it may be an imperfect
      summation — ⋱ attempts to acknowledge how ideas morph in their retelling.
      This imperfection is noted by brown, too, as she writes, “Lineage is both
      important for me to name, and impossible to track.” It also easily creates
      a bridge of shared references between us and brown, should we be familiar
      with any of the themes, people, or media she mentions. And it’s generous —
      readers now have more ways to learn, more surface area to enter this
      particular world of ideas.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I am not a solitary thinker, or solitary learner, or solitary channel of
      these universal wisdoms and universal truths ... I’m constantly learning
      from other people. I weave. We all weave in different ways. What is the
      tapestry of lessons and wisdom that are unique for me? Each person ends up
      with a different tapestry, but you start to see patterns amongst them.<br /><br />
      adrienne maree brown ⋱ Roxana Fabius, Patricia M. Hernandez, Mindy Seu
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In her book, brown shares that “emergence is beyond what the sum of its
      parts could even imagine.” She clearly states that the concept of
      “emergent strategy” takes root from the work of science fiction author
      Octavia Butler. This reminded us of Butler’s ideas around “<a
        href="http://web.mit.edu/m-I-t/science_fiction/transcripts/butler_delany_index.html"
        class="phrase"
        >primitive hypertext</a
      >,” which Laurel first read about through an
      <a
        href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/kameelah-janan-rasheed-on-research-and-archiving/"
        class="special"
        >interview with the artist Kameelah Janan Rasheed</a
      >
      in <i>The Creative Independent</i>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I generally have four or five books open around the house — I live alone;
      I can do this — and they are not books on the same subject. They don’t re-
      late to each other in any particular way, and the ideas they present
      bounce off one another. And I like this effect. I also listen to
      audio-books, and I’ll go out for my morning walk with tapes from two very
      different audio-books, and let those ideas bounce off each other, simmer,
      reproduce in some odd way, so that I come up with ideas that I might not
      have come up with if I had simply stuck to one book until I was done with
      it and then gone and picked up another. So, I guess, in that way, I’m
      using a kind of primitive hypertext.<br /><br />
      Octavia Butler ⋱ Kameelah Janan Rasheed ⋱ Laurel Schwulst
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Both brown and Butler demonstrate how research actually takes place.
      Instead of obfuscating their references, they share them, acknowledging
      multiple sources, academic or otherwise. In their work, many influences
      come together to help form something new, and it’s often most productive
      if these come from very different sources. We appreciated this generosity.
      They revealed and acknowledged their learning trails. They didn’t try to
      take credit for an ongoing lineage because their work is stronger and more
      accessible by including them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a <i>C Magazine</i> essay, “<a
        href="https://cmagazine.com/articles/feminist-approaches-to-citation"
        class="special"
        >Feminist Approaches to Citation</a
      >,” author Maiko Tanaka reflects on a quote from poet Claudia Rankine,
      which was shared with her by a friend:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I’ve since gone back to Rankine’s quotation many times, and each time I
      read it I see new nuances... Sometimes I even realize I’ve completely
      misread a word due to my friend’s nearly illegible handwriting. This
      particular act of citation functions not merely as providing the source of
      an idea or paying due to its author, but is specific to the situation it
      brings into being. … The words from the quote and the ways it is set up by
      my friend cannot be separated. Together they make up an entangled source
      of wisdom and support, performed as a resource for the future.<br /><br />
      Maiko Tanaka (who was unpacking a quote by ⋱ ) Claudia Rankine (which was
      originally shared by ⋱ ) Maiko’s friend
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Tanaka expresses how alive a reference can be. Her paper begins and
      circles back, showing how returning to a source actually enlivens its
      message, transforming it into a site of rediscovery. Sharing citations
      also develops community, “turning a personal source of empowerment into
      collective agency.”
    </p>

    <h2>Past, Present, Future</h2>
    <p>
      In late 2020 we walked around the winding paths of Green-Wood Cemetery, a
      place where it’s almost impossible not to think about time and our place
      within it. Mindy and Laurel were having a discussion about citations in
      relation to time — future, present, past — when Laura uttered
      “multidimensional citation.” Actively linking present to both past and
      future simultaneously, ⋱ honors past building blocks while also
      acknowledging that whatever one is doing presently could be useful to the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Productive questions came to mind: Who came before us? How can we
      acknowledge them and use their work to create something new? We realized a
      formal connection with our symbol of the three dots:
    </p>
    <pre>
. Past
  . Present
    . Future
</pre
    >
    <p>
      We later learned that in the Unicode standard, our symbol ⋱ is formally
      called the “Down Right Diagonal Ellipsis” (U+22F1). We explored the roots
      of its mathematical origin, here pictured in a matrix.
    </p>
    <figure class="medium">
      <img src="images/multi-matrix.png" alt="a mathematical matrix" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      A matrix is a set of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices have
      wide applications in fields including engineering, physics, economics,
      statistics, and computer graphics. When the ⋱ appears in a matrix, it
      functions like an ellipsis, but trailing in another direction. In this
      mathematical context, the ⋱ means “and so forth.” More specifically, the
      matrix pictured above is called an “identity matrix.” Agnes Cameron, our
      friend and engineer, explained it further in a phone call with Mindy.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The image that you sent is not just any matrix; it’s a really special
      matrix called the identity matrix ... The three descending dots stand in
      as a kind of “etc.” By looking at the values around it for reference, you
      know what all of the other values will be. In order for this shorthand to
      be effective, you must understand the context.<br /><br />
      Agnes Cameron ⋱ Mindy Seu
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Agnes’s explanation felt eerily similar to our understanding of
      multidimensional citation. Similar to the mathematical symbol, ⋱ is
      surrounded by those who have been given credit, but it also implies
      there’s an unknown number of additional people in its citational web. The
      symbol inherently acknowledges there is *more* than what is explicitly
      listed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The designer Sheila Levrant de Bretteville uses ellipses frequently in her
      graphic design work. One example is <i>At long last ...</i> (1999),
      installed at the Inwood-207th Street subway station in New York. Commuters
      are invited to complete the title phrase, which is embedded as large
      shimmering letters in the station wall. The mark is an invitation for
      inclusion — to encourage others to complete messages, ask questions, and
      add their own voice and subjectivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are ellipses covertly embedded in other works by de Bretteville,
      too, such as her iconic poster for the <i>Women in Design</i> conference
      in 1975 at the Woman’s Building in Los Angeles.
    </p>
    <p>
      These dots depict phases of the moon, and each illuminates Angelica
      Kauffman’s 1782 painting,
      <i
        >The Artist in the Character of Design Listening to the Inspiration of
        Poetry</i
      >. In a lecture at the Yale School of Art in January 2020, de Bretteville
      described the importance of this painting:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The designer is influenced by poetry, embracing personal subjectivity and
      individual expression.<br /><br />Sheila Levrant de Bretteville (in a
      lecture she co-presented with ⋱ ) Laura Coombs
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      De Bretteville’s email signature contains a reference to the 1962 “Port
      Huron Statement” and reads, “The object is not to have one’s own way so
      much as to have a way of one’s own.” Not only does Sheila encourage a way
      of one’s own, she also embraces the clunkiness, imperfection, and
      generosity that multidimensional citation represents. In their book,
      <i>Glossary of Undisciplined Design</i>, editors Anja Kaiser and Rebecca
      Stephany quote de Bretteville’s 1974 essay, “A Reexamination of Some
      Aspects of the Design Arts from the Perspective of a Woman Designer”:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I increasingly question the desirability of simplicity and clarity. The
      thrust to control almost inevitably operates through simplification.
      Control is undermined by ambiguity, choice, and complexity because
      subjective facts in the user become more effective and the user is invited
      to participate. Participation undermines control.<br /><br />
      Sheila Levrant de Bretteville ⋱ Anja Kaiser, Rebecca Stephany
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ⋱ is unlike a normal citation because it acknowledges citations are
      active, not static. It reminds us not only of lineage, but also of our own
      participation in this chain; not only how we’re citing others from the
      past, but also how we would like to be cited in the future ... which
      influences how we mark the trajectory in the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we’re trying to frame as multidimensional citation is inherent to the
      practice of storytelling. In a conversation for the journal
      <i>DATA browser</i>, Mindy spoke to Amelia Winger-Bearskin, a member of
      the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy), who said she often has to
      explain that there is no such thing as a singular author. “A storyteller
      is [someone who...] has been entrusted from the elders to be given
      stories,” she said. “Then you’re expected to take those stories and make
      them relevant for the generation that you’re telling them to. But most
      importantly, a storyteller reflects what the culture needs to hear at that
      moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She then gave an example of how this citational practice might
      materialize:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      If I was a technologist and the oldest person of the next generation is
      only five years old, how do I communicate everything I know about
      technology that needs to carry on for the next generation? I have to tell
      her these stories in ways she might remember. Maybe I put it in the
      designs of the clothing she wears; I weave it into the baskets that she’s
      born in. I’m going to essentially decentralize this to the point where a
      piece of this thread is in everything she touches. We have to make sure
      that it’s accessible to all these different types of people that will be
      able to carry that forward.<br /><br />

      Amelia Winger-Bearskin ⋱ Mindy Seu
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Like Amelia, we also believe there can be value in translating or
      re-presenting an old, important idea for a new age. Perhaps it’s
      translated into a new language or re-presented for a different culture,
      made resonant again through an imaginative retelling for a specific
      audience. Our addition to this lineage is our way of presenting our
      citational lineages and noting how it might be adapted. It’s an embedded,
      visual reminder to cultivate multidimensional, deep, surprising, and
      therefore valuable learning trails and suggested paths. “Future” is how
      you add yourself to the trail.

      ⋱ has a few shortcomings. It still places prominence on individuals, and
      many may be overlooked or mispositioned in the trail. It does not solve
      every citational woe, but at least proposes an *intentional* approach to
      citation — one that crystallizes a network and acknowledges a more robust,
      if clunky, web. In this clunkiness there is room for expansion. It
      encourages improvement over time. In brown’s requoting of her mentor Grace
      Lee Boggs, she writes, “The most radical thing she could do was to keep
      evolving her ideas as new information came her way.” This was articulated
      firsthand in Laurel’s interview with
      <a href="https://html.energy/neta-ritu.html" class="special"
        >Neta Bomani and Ritu Ghiya for the podcast <i>HTML Energy</i></a
      >. After the conversation, Bomani and Ghiya were able to annotate the
      transcription with their corrections:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I find that &lt;span&gt; tags are really fun to manipulate and play with.
      Actually scratch “manipulate,” I’m just gonna say “play with” and “tease
      out a bit.”<br /><br />
      Neta Bomani (in conversation with ⋱ ) Ritu Ghiya (who were both
      interviewed by ⋱ ) Laurel Schwulst
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Bomani offered a note with the amended transcript, “I corrected myself
      because I’m practicing not using language that reifies master/slave or
      command and control logic within programming. Here, I don’t see my col-
      laboration with the computer as a manipulation, but rather an act of play
      where I tease out the options the computer’s programming language has for
      me.”
    </p>

      When adding our own names to a trail, we remember to circle back to our
      motives for sharing. Adopting a multidimensional approach enacts a spirit
      of generosity, openness, and continuity. It’s a way to leave things open
      and to signal there’s no ultimate source, no beginning or end.
