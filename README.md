# Demo 1 â€” Text

A simple HTML & CSS site that presents a piece of text with some differently styled links, and some images.

The form is inspired by https://mindyseu.com. The content is [Multidimensional Citation](https://www.servinglibrary.org/journal/17/multidimensional-citation), an essay by Laura Coombs, Laurel Schwulst (me), and Mindy Seu, 2022, originally published in <i>The Serving Library</i>.

Created by [Laurel Schwulst](https://laurelschwulst.com) for a workshop with the British Art Network, May 2024.
